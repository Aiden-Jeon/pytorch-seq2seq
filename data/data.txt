Patriots Day, Peter Berg’s new thriller that recreates the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing and the ensuing manhunt that followed it, is a surprisingly oblique, morally ambiguous movie from a typically straightforward filmmaker.
  Patriots Day takes an unexpectedly cynical view of the chaos, rash   and bureaucratic infighting that followed the bombing —  the question is whether that was Berg’s intended message.
  For its grim   running time, the movie celebrates the men on the ground who helped bring the bombers to justice, but it’s the glimpses of something more complicated than jingoism that really linger.
  The scene that best illustrates this dichotomy comes late in Patriots Day.
  As the search for one of the bombers, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, intensifies, his brother’s wife Katherine (Melissa Benoist) is brought in for interrogation on her connections to the case.
  As she asks for a lawyer, protesting that she "has rights," her steely interviewer (Khandi Alexander) tuts, "Honey, you ain’t got shit. "
  It’s a Hollywood line intended to provoke a big cheer from the audience, despite its queasy legal undertones.
  But the film presents it as just that —  a cheesy line.
